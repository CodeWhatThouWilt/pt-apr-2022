# Directions for cloning repo

1. Open a terminal in the directory you want the repo to exist in. (personally I recommend having something like a Programming directory to store your projects in)
2. Once you're in the directory you want to clone into run this command in your terminal:

For students in eastern cohort:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeWhatThouWilt/pt-apr-2022.git --branch est
```

For students in western cohort:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeWhatThouWilt/pt-apr-2022.git --branch pst
```

3. That's it! You're all set! Now if you want to access any of the material from discussions or practice solutions you just need to be in the cohort directory and run:
```
git pull
```
