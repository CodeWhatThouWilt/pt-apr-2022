# May 2023 PT Repo

## Directions for cloning repo

1. Open a terminal in the directory you want the repo to exist in. (personally I recommend having something like a Programming directory to store your projects in)
2. Once you're in the directory you want to clone into run this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/CodeWhatThouWilt/pt-apr-2022.git
```


3. That's it! You're all set! Now if you want to access any of the material from discussions or practice solutions you just need to be in the cohort directory and run:
```
git pull
```
Running the above command will fetch anything that has been changed in the repo. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me on slack!

## How to use this repo

There's currently 4 root directories:

- East / West - Contains all solutions and walkthroughs for each cohort
- Cheetsheets - Contains quick code snippets / commands for specific content
- Extras - Contains extra material such as console commands / extensions etc
