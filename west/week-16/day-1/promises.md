# Promises

## Vocabulary

- Action: The primary function of the promise (ex: fetch from an API)
- States:
  - Pending: The promise has not been rejected or resolved
  - Resolved: The promise's action has succeeded
  - Rejected: The promise's action has failed
- Settled: When a promise is fulfilled or rejected

## Side notes

- A promise can only succeed or fail one time.
- A promise cannot change states once it has been settled.
