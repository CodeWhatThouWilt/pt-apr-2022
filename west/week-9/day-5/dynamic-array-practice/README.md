# Implement a Dynamic Array

Clone the project from the [starter][arrays].

Now that you've gone a bit deeper into understanding how arrays work in
JavaScript, let's try to implement one on your own! Recall that the Array class
includes the following:

* Properties:
  * length
* Methods:
  * read
  * push
  * pop
  * shift
  * unshift
  * indexOf
  * resize

For these exercises, you may not use any built-in JavaScript array methods.

You may use:

* `new Array(size)` to create new storage arrays
* `arr[i]` to read/write elements by index

You must call resize whenever the size of your array exceeds the capacity.

To run tests

1. Clone the starter and navigate to `dynamic-array`
2. `npm install` to install the test packages
3. `npm test` to run tests
4. Implement code in `dynamic-array.js` until all tests are green.

Tip: Reading test specs is key to understanding the problem.

## Learning Goals

* Identify the mechanics and complexity of adding and removing elements from an
  Array
* Solve the memory equation to retrieve data from an array
* Describe the resizing property of Dynamic Arrays and why it's needed
* Implement a Stack data structure using an array
* Select an Array or Stack when they are the appropriate tool for solving a
  problem
