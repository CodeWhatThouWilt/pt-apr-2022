# Advanced Phase 9: Aggregation

So far, you've only really done aggregates on multiple data records OR on
associated data on a single data record.

Now, you will attempt to do aggregates on associated data for multiple data
records - without committing N + 1 queries.

Examine the query used in the `GET /classrooms` route handler. Your frontend
team would like this endpoint to have some aggregate stats readily available for
each classroom in the response.

## Phase 9A: Average grade per Classroom

Find the average grade for each classroom record in the classroom list returned
from this endpoint. 

- The average grade value for a classroom should be set as a property of
`avgGrade` on the classroom record's data.

- The average grade for a `Classroom` should be calculated from all the
`StudentClassroom` records associated with that `Classroom`.

- Use the `include` and `group` query options to add an aggregate column value
of `avgGrade` onto each `Classroom` record returned from the query. You will
need to [group] by `Classroom.id` in order to calculate the `avgGrade` for each
individual classroom instead of for all classrooms

- **DO NOT** use N + 1 queries to find the average grade for each `Classroom`
record.

### Result

Test your endpoint to check if average grade is displaying correctly.

The `GET /classrooms?name=Mr.%20Collins` endpoint should return the following
values:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 16,
    "name": "Mr. Collins",
    "studentLimit": 30,
    "createdAt": "2022-03-04T02:46:19.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2022-03-04T02:46:19.000Z",
    "avgGrade": 2.9655172413793105
  }
]
```

## Phase 9B: Actual Number of Students per Classroom

Find the actual number of students for each classroom record in the classroom
list returned from this endpoint. 

- The actual number of students value for a classroom should be set as a
property of `numStudents` on the classroom record's data.

- The actual number of students for a `Classroom` should be calculated from
counting all the `StudentClassroom` records associated with that `Classroom`.

- Use the `include` and `group` query options to add an aggregate column value
of `numStudents` onto each `Classroom` record returned from the query. 

- **DO NOT** use N + 1 queries to find the actual number of students for each
`Classroom` record.

### Result

Test your endpoint to check if the number of students is displaying correctly.

The `GET /classrooms?name=Mr.%20Collins` endpoint should now return the same
values as before but with a new property of `numStudents` added to the first
record.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 16,
    "name": "Mr. Collins",
    "studentLimit": 30,
    "createdAt": "2022-03-04T02:46:19.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2022-03-04T02:46:19.000Z",
    "avgGrade": 2.9655172413793105,
    "numStudents": 29
  }
]
```
