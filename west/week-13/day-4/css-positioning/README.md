# Practice: CSS Positioning

Now, it's time to practice your understanding of **CSS Positioning**.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

Once you've in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser
to view the webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser.
The only file you will need to edit for this practice is __main.css__.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Background and Context

You will begin with a web page that has all of the HTML and a little CSS
completed. You only need to add to the CSS file to complete each phase.

## Phase 1 - Set the position property of each box

The first step is to change the position property of each colored box. The five
property values are:

1. `static`
2. `relative`
3. `absolute`
4. `fixed`
5. `sticky`

## Phase 2 - Manipulating the element's position

All position properties except for static can use the  `top`, `right`,
`bottom` and `left` properties to determine the elements position on the page.
It is good to learn how to manipulate where each element is on the page and how
they affect each other. Recall the positioning reading and use what you know to
manipulate the boxes' positions. Feel free to play around with the positioning
of the elements and experience how they affect each other. You can change the
`height` and `width` to your liking as well.

## Phase 3 - Stacking elements

Now, that you have some practice setting where the element's position is, you
can stack elements on top of each other. You can do this with the `absolute`
positioned element and use the `top`, `right`, `left`, and `bottom` properties.
THen you can set the order of which elements overlap each other with the
`z-index`. Try using the `z-index` to change the order of what is seen first.
