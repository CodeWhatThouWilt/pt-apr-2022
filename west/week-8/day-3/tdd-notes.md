# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that promotes the writing of tests before the actual implementation of features. It is based on a rapid, repetitive cycle involving three stages: Red, Green, and Refactor.

## The TDD Cycle

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that captures what you want to develop.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Look at the code and think about how to improve its design without changing its behavior.

The process is iterative and encourages developers to think about the specifications and requirements before diving into writing the code. This leads to a better understanding of the feature and, in many cases, a cleaner, more precise implementation.

## The Testing Pyramid

The Testing Pyramid is a concept that helps teams remember to balance their test suites. It encourages a large base of unit tests, a smaller number of integration tests, and an even smaller number of end-to-end tests. The three levels are:

1. **Unit Tests**: These are the most granular tests, typically focusing on individual functions or methods. They are the base of the pyramid, meaning we should have more of these than any other type of tests.
2. **Integration Tests**: These tests check that various pieces of the system work together correctly. They sit above unit tests in the pyramid, meaning we should have fewer integration tests than unit tests.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: These tests check the system as a whole, from one end to the other, to ensure it works as expected. They sit at the top of the pyramid, indicating that we should have the fewest number of these tests, due to their complexity and execution time.
