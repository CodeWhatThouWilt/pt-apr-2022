# Pokedex Backend

This is the backend for the Pokedex exercises.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Copy the **.env.example** file to a new file in the same location called
   **.env**
   * The server should be listening for requests on port `5000`
   * The SQLite3 database file should be **db/dev.db**
4. Run
   * `npm run db:migrate` - create the database and tables
   * `npm run db:seed:all` - insert seed data
   * `npm start` - start the backend server

## Images

Some of the API results have image URLs associated with them. You can get them
from this service. For example, if the service is hosted at
`http://localhost:5000`, then `http://localhost:5000/images/pokemon_snaps/5.svg`
will show the image for the Pokemon with the image URL
`/images/pokemon_snaps/5.svg`.
