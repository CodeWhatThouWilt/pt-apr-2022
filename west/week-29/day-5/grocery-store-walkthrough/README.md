# Grocery Store App

In this project, youâ€™ll connect Redux to a React application. You'll configure
a Redux store, create Redux reducers and action creators, and use them in a
Grocery Store application to add produce to a shopping cart. You'll also learn
how to normalize data in a Redux store.

When you finish today's project, your application should have the following
features:

- Display all the produce in a list
- Add produce to a cart
- Increment/decrement the quantity of produce in the cart
- Checkout the cart

## Phase 0: Familiarize yourself with the code

Clone the starter repository from the `Download` link below.

Run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server.

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000]. You should see the text "Grocery Store".
If you click on the "Checkout" button in the navigation bar, it should open a
side menu. Since there is no produce listed, you cannot add items to the
shopping cart yet.

The `Cart`, `ProduceList`, and `ProduceDetails` are the components you need to
connect to the Redux store. Take a look at the code there to familiarize
yourself with it.

__src/mockData/produce.json__ provides the mock data that you will use to
populate the Redux store. The file has a JSON array of objects. Each object has
the following structure:

```plaintext
{
  id: ID,
  name: String,
  liked: Boolean
}
```

In your preview of the code, make sure to understand how all the components
connect (i.e., the parent-child relationships of all the components, the
component tree).

## Phase 1: Set Up

### Install dependencies

`npm install` the following dependencies:

- `redux` - the Redux package
- `react-redux` - for connecting Redux to React

`npm install -D` the following dev-dependencies:

- `redux-logger` - a debugging tool for logging all actions dispatched

### Configure the Redux store

First thing you need to do is set up and configure the Redux store.

Create a folder called __store__ inside of __src__. Inside of that folder,
create a file called __index.js__. In this file, you will define the root
reducer and a function that will return a Redux store.

Import `createStore`, `combineReducers`, `applyMiddleware`, and `compose` from
redux.

```js
// ./src/store/index.js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from "redux";
```

- `createStore` - creates a Redux store
- `combineReducers` - creates one reducer from multiple reducers as slices of
  state
- `applyMiddleware` - a store enhancer that will allow you to attach middlewares
  (a middleware is a function called before any action hits the root reducer)
- `compose` - another store enhancer that will allow you to use more than one
  store enhancer

Next, define the `rootReducer` which will be the root reducer for the Redux
store. The `rootReducer` will just be the return of `combineReducers` invoked
with an empty object for now.

```js
// ./src/store/index.js
// ...
const rootReducer = combineReducers({

});
```

Now, you are going to create a store enhancer that will be set only when your
application is in development. When in development, you want to add the
`redux-logger` middleware and the Redux dev tools extension store enhancer to
your store. For `redux-logger`, you will use `applyMiddleware`, which returns
a store enhancer. The store enhancer for the Redux dev tools extension is set
by the extension to a global property,
`window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__`. This store enhancer combines
other store enhancers into one, just like `compose` from `redux` does.

Set the `enhancer` variable when in development to use these enhancers like so:

```js
// ./src/store/index.js
// ...
let enhancer;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  const logger = require("redux-logger").default;
  const composeEnhancers =
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
  enhancer = composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(logger));
}
```

Let's break this down.

The `logger` variable is set to the `default` export of the imported
`redux-logger` package using `require` instead of ES6 module imports. Why? ES6
module imports must be defined at the very top of the file in the outermost
scope and will be loaded in all node environments. However, `redux-logger` is a
development dependency and cannot be loaded in production. Loading it with
`require` is needed if you only want it in a certain node environment.

The `composeEnhancers` variable is set to the Redux dev tools extension's
store enhancer, `window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__` or the `compose`
function from `redux` if the extension fails to load or if you don't have the
extension installed in your browser.

The Redux `compose` function takes in store enhancers as its arguments and
combines them to create a single store enhancer. The only other store enhancer
that you need is the `applyMiddleware` invoked with the loaded `logger`.
`enhancer` is set to the combined store enhancer.

Finally, define a function called `configureStore` that will take in a
`preloadedState` and return the result of `createStore` invoked with the
`rootReducer`, the `preloadedState`, and the `enhancer`. Export the
`configureStore` function as the default export.

```js
// ./src/store/index.js
// ...
const configureStore = (preloadedState) => {
  return createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancer);
};

export default configureStore;
```

### Provide the Redux store

Now, you need to wrap the React application with the Redux store provider.

Import the `configureStore` function into the entry file, __src/index.js__.
Import the `Provider` component from `react-redux`.

Initialize a variable called `store` and set it to the return of
`configureStore` (a `preloadedState` does not need to be passed in, it can be
`undefined`).

In the `Root` function component, wrap the `BrowserRouter` component with the
`Provider` component. Pass the prop of `store` with the value of `store` into
the `Provider`.

Your entry file should look like this:

```js
// ./src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import configureStore from './store';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

const store = configureStore();

function Root() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>
    </Provider>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Root />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Test your setup

Let's test your setup!

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000] and open up the browser's dev tools. In the
console, you should see a message about an invalid reducer. That's because the
`rootReducer` isn't combining any reducers yet. Ignore this warning for now.

Open the "Redux" tab in your browser's dev tools. You should **not** see the
message "No store found".

In your entry file, expose the `store` variable on the `window` **only in
development** for testing purposes.

```js
// ./src/index.js
// ...
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  window.store = store;
}
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000] and refresh. You should see the `store` on
the `window` in your browser's dev tools console. If you call `store.getState()`
then you should just get back an empty object.

If you are having issues while testing, check your syntax in your store and
entry files.

Commit your setup code!
