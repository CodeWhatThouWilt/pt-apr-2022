# Scope Project

It's time to get some practice using scope in the wild! This task includes a

available at the top of each file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the root project directory (if needed)
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `npm test` to run the test cases
