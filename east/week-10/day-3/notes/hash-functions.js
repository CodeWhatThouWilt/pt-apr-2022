// Hash functions

// Efficient for data indexing
// Only works in one direction. Doesn't work like encryption where you can decrypt the output.

// Maps arbitrary data to a deterministic, fixed-size output
// What's this mean?
// A hash function takes in an input and runs it through a set of deterministic steps, and returns
// a scrambled output. Given the same input, it will ALWAYS return the same output.

// Hash Tables (Hash maps)
// Can be used for key/value storage with constant big-O time complexity for insertion, access and
// search
