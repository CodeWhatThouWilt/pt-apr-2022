# Recursion Problems

Here we `go(go(go()))`! It's time to flex your coding muscles on recursion. For
each problem, implement a **recursive** function that satisfies all the listed
requirements. Iterative solutions will be considered incorrect. The problems
aren't dependent on each other and may be completed in any order you wish.

As you complete each problem, use `mocha` to test your solutions. Make sure
you're in the project's root: you should be in the same place as the `problems/`
and `test/` directories. Once there, run the following command:

```sh
> mocha
```
