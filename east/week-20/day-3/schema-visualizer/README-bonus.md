# BONUS Exercise: SQL Relational Database Schema Visualizer

In this exercise, you will continue using an online tool to create a diagram
for a SQL relational database.

## Continue exploring with the previous schema

Take the remaining time to add more fields, tables and relationships. Drag the
tables around in the diagram to make it look nice.

Here are a few suggestions to get your started. Please come up with more or
different options on your own!

* Manufacturer for each toy (one manufacturer can make many toys)
* Purchase date for each toy
* Parents of each kid (each kid has up to two parents, each parent can have
  multiple kids)
* Current school for each kid, grade in that school would be nice to include
* Teacher or teachers for each kid, and the school where each teacher works
* Consider: What is the value in relating kids directly to schools, when they
  are indirectly related through their teacher(s)?

Be creative! As you work, discover what questions you have so you can bring them
to your instructions during your next discussion.

> Tip: Write down questions as you have them while you are problem-solving. If
> you get a solution, you can cross them off your list of ones to ask, and
> perhaps you'll find that others had the same or similar questions too!
