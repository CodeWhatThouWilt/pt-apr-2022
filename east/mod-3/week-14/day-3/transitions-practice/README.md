# Practice: CSS Transitions

Now, it's time to practice your understanding of the
**CSS: Transitions**.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

Once you've in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser
to view the webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser.
The only file you will need to edit for this practice is __main.css__.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Background and Context

You will begin with a web page that has all of the HTML and a little CSS
completed. You only need to add to the CSS to complete each phase.

## Phase 1 - Rotate

The first step is to use the CSS transition `transform`. Your goal is to rotate
the rocket 250 degrees when you hover over it. Follow the instructions and use
the gif as an example.

> Hint:
> The [MDN docs for transform] and [MDN docs for hover] or other online
resources may help.

## Phase 2 - Translate

The next step is to use the CSS transition `transform` to move the astronaut
element 100 pixels on the x axis when you hover over it. Follow the
instructions and use the gif as the targeted example.

## Bonus: Spin

The last step is to use what you have larned about transitions to create
a continuously fluid spinning animation. Follow the instructions in the bonus
section to create a smooth 360 deg spinning Earth.
