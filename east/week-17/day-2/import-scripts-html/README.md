# Practice: Importing Scripts into HTML

In this practice, you will import JavaScript script files into an HTML page to
be executed when the HTML page loads the scripts in the browser.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

## Instructions

In the starter, you have been given some simple scripts that will run on an HTML
page. However, none of them have been properly imported into the HTML. Your job
will be to import them properly using the `<script>` tag.

The scripts will be placed in varying folder structures. Keep in mind the
structure and file paths when you are importing the scripts.

The scripts should be in the order:

- __level1.js__
- __level2.js__
- __level3.js__
- __level4.js__

It is up to you whether you want to place them in the head, body, or both.

Do NOT touch __app.js__. Instead, when you have finished importing, run
`node app.js` from the base directory. Open [localhost:5000] in your browser
and open the console to make sure the scripts were imported properly. You
should see a thumbs up created by ASCII characters, like so:
